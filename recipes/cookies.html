    <h3><em>Description</em></h3>

    <p>THE best super soft peanut butter cookies (seriously though, the actual best). Sink your teeth into that perfectly soft and chewy texture and you'll see why these are the only peanut butter cookies you'll ever need!</p>

    <h4>Here's what you'll need:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter - room temp</li>
        <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar (plus 2 tablespoons for rolling)</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and very lightly grease a baking sheet or line with a baking mat.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream together butter, peanut butter, brown sugar, and 1/4 cup granulated sugar for 2-3 minutes until light and fluffy. Mix in egg and vanilla until blended.</li>
        <li>Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients and mix until combined (do not over mix). Roll dough into balls (two regular size cookie scoops or about 3 tablespoons, the balls should be fairly big - this is the key to a super soft texture!)</li>
        <li>Roll cookie dough balls in remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, then place on baking sheet 2-3 inches apart. Use a fork to gently press a criss-cross pattern into each cookie dough ball, only pressing ball down about half way.</li>
        <li>Bake for 8-9 minutes - DO NOT OVER BAKE. The cookies should just begin to crack on top. Allow to cool 1-2 minutes on baking sheet, then transfer to a cooling rack. Store in an airtight container at room temperature up to 5 days (they are softest on day 1 and 2!).</li>
    </ol>
